## Prerequisites
This project runs as a plugin of [OpenSearch Dashboards](**https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch-Dashboards) and needs an [OpenSearch server](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch) running with the [Security Plugin](https://github.com/opensearch-project/security) installed. At the time of this writing there is a strict version check between these components, so we recommend running all of them from their respective branches with matching versions (this will also ensure they work well together before we cut a new release.)

As a prerequisite, please follow [the developer guide of the Security Plugin](https://github.com/opensearch-project/security/blob/main/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md). This will leave you with a running OpenSearch server with security enabled. For the sake of this guide, let's assume the latest versions at the time of writing (`1.3.0-SNAPSHOT` for OpenSearch and OpenSearch Dashboards, and `1.3.0.0-SNAPSHOT` for both backend and frontend (this repo) security plugins.) Update the config file (`config/opensearch.yml`) to look like this one:

```yaml
######## Start OpenSearch Security Demo Configuration ########

#WARNING: revise all the lines below before you go into production

plugins.security.ssl.transport.pemcert_filepath: esnode.pem
plugins.security.ssl.transport.pemkey_filepath: esnode-key.pem
plugins.security.ssl.transport.pemtrustedcas_filepath: root-ca.pem
plugins.security.ssl.transport.enforce_hostname_verification: false
plugins.security.ssl.http.enabled: true
plugins.security.ssl.http.pemcert_filepath: esnode.pem
plugins.security.ssl.http.pemkey_filepath: esnode-key.pem
plugins.security.ssl.http.pemtrustedcas_filepath: root-ca.pem
plugins.security.allow_unsafe_democertificates: true
plugins.security.allow_default_init_securityindex: true
plugins.security.authcz.admin_dn:
- CN=kirk,OU=client,O=client,L=test, C=de

plugins.security.audit.type: internal_opensearch
plugins.security.enable_snapshot_restore_privilege: true
plugins.security.check_snapshot_restore_write_privileges: true
plugins.security.restapi.roles_enabled: ["all_access", "security_rest_api_access"]
plugins.security.system_indices.enabled: true
plugins.security.system_indices.indices: [".opendistro-alerting-config", ".opendistro-alerting-alert*", ".opendistro-anomaly-results*", ".opendistro-anomaly-detector*", ".opendistro-anomaly-checkpoints", ".opendistro-anomaly-detection-state", ".opendistro-reports-*", ".opendistro-notifications-*", ".opendistro-notebooks", ".opensearch-observability", ".opendistro-asynchronous-search-response*", ".replication-metadata-store"]
node.max_local_storage_nodes: 3

######## End OpenSearch Security Demo Configuration ########
```

Next, we need to check out OpenSearch Dashboards from the branch matching our version, in this example that would be the [1.x branch](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch-Dashboards/tree/1.x). Follow the [developer guide](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch-Dashboards/blob/1.x/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) and replace the version of  `opensearch-dashboards.yml` there with this:

```yaml
server.host: "0"
opensearch.hosts: ["https://localhost:9200"]
opensearch.ssl.verificationMode: none
opensearch.username: "kibanaserver"
opensearch.password: "kibanaserver"
opensearch.requestHeadersWhitelist: [ authorization,securitytenant ]
opensearch_security.multitenancy.enabled: true
opensearch_security.multitenancy.tenants.preferred: ["Private", "Global"]
opensearch_security.readonly_mode.roles: ["kibana_read_only"]

# Use this setting if you are running opensearch-dashboards without https
opensearch_security.cookie.secure: false
```

Note that at this point running `yarn start` will fail, as we still don't have the security plugin installed in Dashboards. We are ready to install it now.

## Building

First create a fork of this repo and clone it locally under the `plugins` directory of the previously cloned OpenSearch Dashboards project, and build the plugin:

```
cd plugins
git clone git@github.com:opensearch-project/security-dashboards-plugin.git
cd security-dashboards-plugin
yarn build
```

We should be able to run Dashboards now changing back to its base directory and running `yarn start`. Navigating to the URL given as console output (something like `http://localhost:5601/omf`) you should now be able to log in with user `admin` and password `admin`.
